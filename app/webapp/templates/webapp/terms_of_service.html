            </div>
            <p>Do not violate anyone else's terms of service to add data to our open source dataset. We appreciate your effort, but that is both unethical and often illegal. Please, please don't do it.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Please do not attempt to scrape this website. We will be uploading our entire dataset to Kaggle every week shortly, and will also offer an API for legitimate programmatic access. Scraping the human-facing site increases our costs and makes it harder to keep this volunteer project running.</p>
